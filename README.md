I was not able to complete
```
When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
Then the game is over
When the game is over
Then I can save my initials and score
```

I was able to have a timer start on the click of start on the front page.  I was also able to have all of my questions pop up after each was answered.  I was also able to subtract time from each wrong answer.

I had trouble getting the last page to pop up giving the user the option to put in their name and have it save to the local storage.
